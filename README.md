Aaron's Test Branch for Side Bar

<h3> Current:
Sidebar renders on the Dashboard page only (Accessed when you log in) as a button only.

<h3> Target:
1. Responsiveness (i.e. if the screen is minimized where will the menu go?) the Navbar is already responsive, it goes in a burger menu(3 horizontal lines) the Sidebar which is there for the dashboard functionality is not responsive yet.
